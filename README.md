# CardoDigitalHumanitiesFinal
Michele's final for Digital Humanities.

The document "QStaxonomy" is a text file which contains all the words which are part of my Question Sequence Taxonomy with varying frequencies.
QStaxonomy is an R script which creates a bar plot so that we can visualize which category is the most frequency in my question sequence corpus.
